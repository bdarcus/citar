** Features
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: features
   :END:

This package provides a completing-read front-end to browse and act on BibTeX, BibLaTeX, and CSL JSON bibliographic data, and LaTeX, markdown, and org-cite editing support.

When used with vertico (or selectrum), embark, and marginalia, it provides similar functionality to helm-bibtex and ivy-bibtex: quick filtering and selecting of bibliographic entries from the minibuffer, and the option to run different commands against them.

With embark, it also makes available at-point actions in org-mode citations.

Here's a screenshot with [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][vertico]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][embark]]. and =consult-completing-read-multiple=.

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installation
   :END:

Bibtex-actions is available for installation from [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].

In addition, the following packages are strongly recommended for the best experience.

1. [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] or [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] (completion interface)
2. [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] (completion style)
3. [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]] (contextual actions)
4. [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]] (annotations, and also candidate classification for Embark)
4. [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]] (enhanced interface for multiple candidate selection)

** Configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: configuration
   :END:

*** Basic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: basic
    :END:

This is the minimal configuration, and will work with any completing-read compliant vertical completion UI, like Vertico, Selectrum, or the built-in icomplete-vertical, with actions available via =M-x= commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package bibtex-completion)

(use-package bibtex-actions
  :bind (("C-c b" . bibtex-actions-insert-citation)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :after (bibtex-completion)
  :config
  (setq bibtex-actions-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib"))
#+END_SRC

Since most of the command logic resides in bibtex-completion, that is where to look for different [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex#basic-configuration-recommended][configuration options]].

*** Embark

Highly recommended, this option adds embark, for contextual access to actions in the minibuffer and at-point.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package bibtex-actions
  :bind (("C-c b" . bibtex-actions-insert-citation)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :after (embark bibtex-completion)
  :config
  ;; Make the 'bibtex-actions' bindings and targets available to `embark'.
  (add-to-list 'embark-target-finders 'bibtex-actions-citation-key-at-point)
  (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(bib-reference . bibtex-actions-map))
  (add-to-list 'embark-keymap-alist '(citation-key . bibtex-actions-buffer-map))
  (setq bibtex-actions-bibliography '("~/bib/references.bib"))

;; use consult-completing-read for enhanced interface
(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :override #'consult-completing-read-multiple)
#+END_SRC

When using this option, these actions are generic, and work the same across org, markdown, and latex modes.

*** Org-Cite

#+CAPTION: org-cite at-point integration with =embark-act=
[[file:images/org-cite-embark-point.png]]

If you use org-mode, this is the best option.
It includes the embark functionality above, but customizes menus and user-experience for org-cite.
In other supported modes, it will work the same as the embark option above.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Set bibliography paths so they are the same.
(defvar my/bibs '("~/bib/references.bib"))

(use-package oc-bibtex-actions
  :bind (("C-c b" . org-cite-insert)
         ("M-o" . org-open-at-point)
         :map minibuffer-local-map
         ("M-b" . bibtex-actions-insert-preset))
  :after (embark oc)
  :config
  (setq bibtex-actions-bibliography my/bibs
        org-cite-global-bibliography my/bibs
        org-cite-insert-processor 'oc-bibtex-actions
        org-cite-follow-processor 'oc-bibtex-actions
        org-cite-activate-processor 'oc-basic))

;; Use consult-completing-read for enhanced interface.
(advice-add #'completing-read-multiple :override #'consult-completing-read-multiple)
#+END_SRC

If you prefer to have the embark menu open with =org-open-at-point=, you should set this variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-at-point-function 'embark-act)
#+END_SRC

You can invoke both =embark-act= and =embark-dwim=, however, independently of =org-at-point=, and in other modes such as =latex-mode=.

Oc-bibtex-actions does not provide activate functionality. 
For that, try [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref-cite][org-ref-cite]]. 
Once installed and loaded, you can configure that like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC
(setq org-cite-activate-processor 'org-ref-cite-activate)
#+END_SRC

If you prefer to use a hydra-based in-buffer interface, you can also use that project's "follow processor":

#+BEGIN_SRC
(setq org-cite-activate-processor 'org-ref-cite-follow)
#+END_SRC

** Rich UI
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: rich-ui
    :END:

There are three sections of the browsing UI.

1. The prefix, exploiting the affixation feature only available starting with Emacs 28, and holding the symbols to indicate the presence of PDFs or notes associated with the entries.
2. The main display, which by default shows author, title, and date.
3. The suffix, which by default shows citekey, reference type, and (if present) tags or keywords.

You can search against all of the above content.
For the prefix, you can filter for associated PDFs or notes using =has:pdf= or =has:note= respectively (and at least with my setup, even the =:p= or =:n= shorthand).

#+CAPTION: UI sections
[[file:images/ui-segments.png]]

*** Templates

The =bibtex-actions-templates= variable configures formatting for these sections, as well as the default note function.
Here's the defaults:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-templates
      '((main . "${author editor:30}     ${date year issued:4}     ${title:48}")
        (suffix . "          ${=key= id:15}    ${=type=:12}    ${tags keywords:*}")
        (note . "#+title: Notes on ${author editor}, ${title}")))
#+END_SRC

Note:

1. You may include multiple variables in a field; the formatter will print the first one it finds.
2. If you plan to use CSL JSON at all, you can and should include CSL JSON variables names where appropriate as such options. The default main template dates field demonstrates this.
3. The asterisk signals to the formatter to use available space for the column.
4. The note template does not take widths, as formatting is inline there rather than columnar.

*** Icons

By default, this UI is plain text, but you can configure it to use icons instead.

#+CAPTION: rich UI with icons screenshot
[[file:images/rich-ui-icons.png]]

Here's how to configure it to use =all-the-icons=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bibtex-actions-symbols
    `((pdf . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'all-the-icons-dred) .
              ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.pdf" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))
      (note . (,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt") .
              ,(all-the-icons-icon-for-file "foo.txt" :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))        
      (link . 
          (,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'all-the-icons-dpurple) .
          ,(all-the-icons-faicon "external-link-square" :v-adjust 0.02 :face 'bibtex-actions-icon-dim)))))
  ;; Here we define a face to dim non 'active' icons, but preserve alignment
  (defface bibtex-actions-icon-dim
      '((((background dark)) :foreground "#282c34")
       (((background light)) :foreground "#fafafa"))
       "Face for obscuring/dimming icons"
       :group 'all-the-icons-faces)
#+END_SRC

** Test Script
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: test-script
    :END:

The repository =test= directory also includes a script you can use to run this and associated packages in the =emacs -Q= sandbox.
To do that, simply run =./run.sh= from the =test= directory.
By default, this will use selectrum as the completion system.
If you would like to try vertico instead, just do =M-x vertico-mode=.

** History and predefined searches
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: history-and-predefined-searches
    :END:

=Bibtex-actions= has functionality similar to the [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex#p][predefined search]] functionality in =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=, but with a different implementation.
Rather than create a new command with the search terms as argument, you just set the =bibtex-actions-presets= variable, and add the strings you want to access:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-presets '("one search string" "another search string"))
#+end_src

You then have two ways to access these strings from the completion prompt:

1. by using =M-n= from the prompt, which will cycle through the strings
2. by calling =bibtex-actions-insert-preset= with a keybinding, and then selecting the string

=Bibtex-actions= also preserves the history of your selections (see caveat below about multiple candidate selection though), which are also accessible in your completion UI, but by using =M-p=.
You can save this history across sessions by adding =bibtex-actions-history= to =savehist-additional-variables=.

** Refreshing the library display
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: refreshing-the-library-display
    :END:

=Bibtex-actions= uses two caches to speed up library display; one for the global bibliography, and another for local files specific to a buffer.
This is great for performance, but means the data can become stale if you modify it.

The =bibtex-actions-refresh= command will reload the caches, and you can call this manually.
You can also call any of the =bibtex-actions= commands with a prefix argument: =C-u M-x bibtex-actions-insert-key=.

Although not default, =bibtex-actions= also provides convenience functions for auto-refreshing cache when bib files change using filenotify.
The simplest use of this functionality is

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bibtex-actions-filenotify-setup '(LaTeX-mode-hook org-mode-hook))
#+END_SRC

This will add watches for the global bib files and in addition add a hook to =LaTeX-mode-hook= and =org-mode-hook= to add watches for local bibliographic files.
By default this will invalidate the cache if a bib file changes. If the bib files change rarely, a more suitable option is to refresh the cache.
This can be achieved by

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-filenotify-callback 'refresh-cache)
#+END_SRC

The behavior can be tweaked more thoroughly by setting =bibtex-actions-filenotify-callback= to a function.
See its documentation for details.
Watches can be also placed on additional files.
This is controlled by the variable =bibtex-actions-filenotify-files=.

Another option to make the completion interface more seamless is to add a hook which generates the cache after a buffer is opened.
This can be done when emacs has been idle (half a second in the example below) with something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun gen-bib-cache-idle ()
  "Generate bib item caches with idle timer"
  (run-with-idle-timer 0.5 nil #'bibtex-actions-refresh))

(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'gen-bib-cache-idle)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'gen-bib-cache-idle)
#+END_SRC

For additional configuration options on this, see [[https://github.com/bdarcus/bibtex-actions/wiki/Configuration#automating-path-watches][the wiki]].

** Notes

This package provides a =bibtex-actions-file-open-note-function= variable, and a simple default function.
To replace the default with one from org-roam-bibtex, you can do:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-file-open-note-function 'orb-bibtex-actions-edit-note)
#+END_SRC

Note, however: if you use that function you need to ensure that the =bibtex-completion-bibliography= variable is correctly set to the same paths as =bibtex-actions-bibliographic=.

** Files, file association and file-field parsing

If you have =bibtex-actions-library-paths= set, the relevant open commands will look in those directories for file names of =CITEKEY.EXTENSION=.
They will also parse contents of a file-field.
The =bibtex-actions-file-parser-functions= variable governs which parsers to use, and there are two included parsers:

1. The default =bibtex-actions-file-parser-default= parser works for simple semi-colon-delimited lists of file paths, as in Zotero.
2. The =bibtex-actions-file-parser-triplet= works for Mendeley and Calibre, which represent files using a format like =:/path/file.pdf:PDF=.

If you have a mix of entries created with Zotero and Calibre, you can set it like so and it will parse both:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq bibtex-actions-file-parser-functions
  '(bibtex-actions-file-parser-default
    bibtex-actions-file-parser-triplet))
#+END_SRC

The =bibtex-actions-file-extension= variable governs which file extensions the open commands will recognize.

The =bibtex-actions-open-library-files= command includes an optional file browser, which can be set with the =bibtex-actions-file-open-prompt= boolean variable.
When used with embark and consult, you will have a range of alternate actions available for the candidates.

#+CAPTION: File candidates with embark options
[[file:images/file-browser-embark.png]]

** Usage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: usage
   :END:

You have a few different ways to use bibtex-actions.

*** Org-cite

Bibtex-actions includes org-cite integration in =oc-bibtex-actions=, which includes a processor with "follow" and "insert" capabilities.

The "insert processor" will use =bibtex-actions-select-refs= to browse your library to insert and edit citations and citation references using the =org-cite-insert= command.

The "activate processor" runs the list of functions in ~oc-bibtex-activation-functions~, which by default is the ~basic~ processor from ~oc-basic~ to provide fontification, and also a little function that adds a keymap for editing citations at point.
That keymap includes the following bindings.

| key       | binding                                 |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------|
| C-d       | oc-bibtex-actions-delete-citation       |
| C-k       | oc-bibtex-actions-kill-citation         |
| S-<left>  | oc-bibtex-actions-shift-reference-left  |
| S-<right> | oc-bibtex-actions-shift-reference-right |

The "follow processor" provides at-point functionality accessible via the =org-open-at-point= command.
By default, in org-mode with org-cite support, when point is on a citation or citation-reference, and you invoke =org-open-at-point=, it will run the default command, which is =bibtex-actions-open=.
Changing this value to =embark-act= with embark installed and configured will provide access to the standard bibtex-actions commands at point.

Org-cite citations include optional "styles" and "variants" to locally modify the citation rendering.
To edit these, just make sure point is on the citation prefix before running =org-cite-insert=, and you will get a list of available styles.
That list is based on your configuration; if you have the =oc-natbib= and =oc-csl= processors configured, for example, the list will include the styles and variants available in those two processors.
The variants included in the bundled processors include the following, with the shortcuts in parentheses:

- =bare= (=b=): without surrounding punctuation
- =caps= (=c=): force initial capitalization
- =full= (=f=): ignore et al shortening for author names

Generally, you shouldn't need these, but they can be useful in certain circumstances.
If an export processor doesn't support a specific variant for a specific style, it should just fallback to the base style.
For example, if you specify =text/f=, and the export processor you use doesn't support the =f= variant there, it should just output as if you specified =text=.

*** =M-x=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: m-x
    :END:

Simply do =M-x= and select the command that you want, enter the terms to find the item you are looking for, and hit return.
This runs the default action: the command you invoked.

Here's the view, using marginalia for annotations.

#+CAPTION: commands available from M-x
[[file:images/m-x.png]]

A note on multiple candidate selection:

These commands do allow you to select multiple items, with two caveats:

1. For this to work correctly, you /must/ use the ampersand (=&=) as =crm-separator= to separate the candidates.
2. We use long candidate strings, so if you use a completion system that requires you to =TAB=-complete, the experience is less-than-ideal.

*** Access an alternate action via =embark-act=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: access-an-alternate-action-via-embark-act
    :END:

If while browsing you instead would rather edit that record, and you have embark installed and configured, this is where =embark-act= comes in.
Simply input the keybinding for =embark-act= (in my case =C-o=), and select the alternate action.

*** Use =embark-collect-snapshot=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-embark-collect-snapshot
    :END:

A final option, that can be useful: run =embark-collect-snapshot= (=S=) from =embark-act=.
This will select the candidate subset, and open it in a separate buffer.
From there, you can run the same options discussed above using =embark-act= (which is also bound to =a= in the collect buffer).

So, for example, say you are working on a paper. You hold the complete super-set of items you are interested in citing at some point in that buffer.
From there, you can run different actions on the candidates at will, rather than search individually for each item you want to cite.

*** Use =bibtex-actions-dwim=
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: use-bibtex-actions-dwim
    :END:

=M-x bibtex-actions-dwim= will run the default action on citation keys found at point directly.
If you have =embark= installed, you use can =embark-dwim= instead for the same behavior, and =embark-act= for additional actions at-point.

If no citation key is found, the minibuffer will open for selection.
You can disable this behavior by setting =bibtex-actions-at-point-fallback= to nil.

** Comparisons
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: comparisons
   :END:

This is inspired by =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=, but is based on =completing-read=.
In comparison:

- like =helm-bibtex=, but unlike =ivy-bibtex=, =bibtex-actions= has support for multi-selection of candidates
- =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex= provide a single command, and the actions accessed from there; =bibtex-actions= provides all of its actions as standard commands, available from =M-x=, without a single entry point.
- =bibtex-actions= is based on =completing-read-multiple=, with a single dependency, and works with different completion systems (though in practice is best supported in =selectrum=) and supporting packages that are =completing-read= compliant; =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex= are based on =helm= and =ivy= respectively.

** Acknowledgements

The ideas in this project were initially worked out in a [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/issues/353][conversation]] with [[https://github.com/mtreca][Maxime Tréca]] and [[https://github.com/minad][Daniel Mendler]]. Daniel, author of [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] and [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]], helped us understand the possibilities of the new suite of completing-read packages, while Maxime came up with an [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/pull/355][initial prototype]].

This code takes those ideas and re-implements them to fill out the feature set, and also optimize the code clarity and performance.

Along the way, [[https://github.com/clemera][Clemens Radermacher]] and [[https://github.com/oantolin][Omar Antolín]] helped with some of the intricacies of completing-read and elisp.

And, of course, thanks to [[https://github.com/tmalsburg][Titus von der Malburg]] for creating and maintaining =bibtex-completion= and =helm-bibtex= and =ivy-bibtex=.
